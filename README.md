# TaskManager Frontend

This is the frontend component of the TaskManager project, developed using React and Vite. It serves as the user interface for managing tasks, assigning them to employees, and viewing task details. The frontend interacts with the backend to provide a complete task management solution. Features missing right now, is viewing some of the components as a normal user. Design made by myself.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Ungkarl/taskmanager-front.git cd taskmanager-front

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using npm:

### 3. Start the Vite React Server

Run the development server using: npm run dev, or use the button in the npm scripts tab.

### 4. Access the application


Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` or whatever the server used as the port.

### 6. Testing

Ensure that the frontend correctly communicates with the backend. You should be able to log in as an admin or user admin: (taskmaster@mcdm.dk, taskmaster), view tasks, add new tasks, and assign tasks to employees.

Feel free to customize and enhance the frontend to meet your needs. For any issues or contributions, refer to the project repository or contact the development team.
